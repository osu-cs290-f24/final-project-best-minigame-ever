# Mini Game:

## Update: Leo Dec.7:
1. Flappy bird game complete, all styling and gamplay is finished for the page.
2. The leaderboard data implementation is still needed.
3. UI for the snake game should be consistant

## Update: Ren Dec.2:

1. Merge 'lightmode.css' and 'darkmode.css' into one 'styles.css' for avoiding avoid bugs that might be caused by frequent switching between different files.
2. Updated { flappyBird.html,leaderboard.html,snake.html } to have the same structure as the homepage.
3. Add the '@about us' button on the homepage and leaderboard, but the dark mode style and page link haven't been implemented yet.
4. I created a logo with the name " Best mini-game ever" using AI logo designer and removed the watermarks using PS. I don't know if that's allowed. The logo also has the function "return to homepage."
5. I created a sidebar using CSS and made sure that the sidebar would not hide the game and leaderboard. But I didn't know if we think the windows, the bug would occur.
6. I find a very useful game web as a template: "http://flappybird.io/", their leaderboard page is really good.
7. I implemented some js parts as the dark mode needed.
8.  Implemented the dark mode, this dark mode still has some bugs: dark mode would not memorize the user preferences when we switch to a different page; I'll fix it.
9.  The color of the light mode and dark mode is still not decided yet, you are free to switch.
10. I will add 'start' and 'stop' game css button later.
11. I will modify Dark/Light icon later.
